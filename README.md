# Some my yapping

Tbh the site strongly vibe-coded cuz i just wanted simple webapp for my notes, so don't gimme no credits. I wouldn't mind seeing your implementation tho.

I've made it in mind to host on my raspi so it's simplest as I can. Again, feel free to do whatever you want with it, I do appreciate any feedback tho.
